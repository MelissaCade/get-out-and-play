# Get Out and Play!

## Description

In this projet we were split into teams to come up with a project idea of our choosing which incorporated all of the tools and elements we have learned thus far in the first month of our class. We were tasked with creating a real world front end application that was responsice and interactive. We used Bootstrap as out CSS framework using 2 different server-side APIs and included a weather modal in the project. It was also required we used local storage and had a polished UI with the user's story in mind. Through this process we reiterated some of the key lessons from the class like utilizing 3rd party APIs and commiting/pulling to/from local storage. Given this was a group project we were also introduce to a collaborative effort on GitHub with coding on our own branches and then creating pull requests which would have to be reviewed and approved by another team member. Our page is a website in which you can view the different variety of national parks in each state of the US. When navigating to a state the user is given the ability to click into a specific park which has a "Learn More" button navigating to a website with additional info of the park as well as a "Forecast" button providing the current and 5 day forecast. All of the info is pulled using 3rd party APIs.

## Installation

Here is the GitHub page to access the project: https://github.com/MelissaCade/get-out-and-play

Once a state is selected, the page will populate with all of the national parks including an image and "Learn More" and "Forecast" buttons. This is shown below:

The user will then identify a specific national park to explore. They are presented with a "Learn More" button which will redirect the user directly to the page on the National Park Service website with more info about that park in addtion to a "Forecast" button. As seen below:

When the "Forecast" button is selected a 5 day forecast modal will appear for the user. In the top right corner of the modal is a "x" button which allows the user to get rid of the modal and continue viewing national parks. This is displayed below:
